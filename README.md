- uPort integration;
- IPFS integration;

- Automated tests;
- Material UI.

## Notes on local deployment

This project's frontend uses uPort's infrastructure for interaction and authentication. This means you must use Rinkeby.

You may however, deploy the contracts locally, run the tests and interact with them through `truffle console`.

## Screenshots

## Tests

1. Start a testnet by running `npm run ganache`
